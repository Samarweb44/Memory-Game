# Memory-Game
Memory Game App (Flutter) I developed a fun and interactive memory game using Flutter, designed to challenge users’ focus and improve their memory skills. The game presents a grid of hidden cards that players must flip over to find matching pairs. With each level, the difficulty increases, making the experience engaging and competitive.
